A middleware server for [my portfolio website](https://github.com/joejo-joestar/joestar), providing Spotify currently playing track, GitHub activity, and Unsplash photo collections.
This project provides a simple Express server with three main API endpoints, each handled in separate route files:

## Routes

> [!NOTE]
> All Routes read from environment variables for API keys and tokens. See each section below for details

### Unsplash Route ([`unsplash.ts`](./routes/unsplash.ts))

Fetch collections and photos from the Unsplash API for the gallery pages.

#### Unsplash Envs

- `UNSPLASH_CLIENT_ID`: required for the requests in the current implementation.
- `UNSPLASH_USERNAME`: required for the `user` parameter for the requests

---

### GitHub Route ([`github.ts`](./routes/github.ts))

Fetch repositories for the `joejo-joestar` account (used to populate the Projects list).

#### GitHub Envs

- `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`: reqiured for requests in current implementation
- `GITHUB_USERNAME`: required for the `user` parameter for the requests

> [!NOTE]
> The helper sends `Authorization: token ${githubToken}` if `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` is provided.

---

### Spotify Route ([`spotify.ts`](./routes/spotify.ts))

Obtain an access token via a stored refresh token, and fetch the currently-playing item for the authenticated Spotify account.

#### Spotify Envs

- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`: The `Client ID` from the app created in [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/create)
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`: The `Client Secret` from the app created in [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/create)
- `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN`: The refresh token gotten after following the steps provided in the [Spotify Setup](#spotify-setup) section

#### Spotify Endpoints

- Token endpoint: `https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token`
- Now playing: `https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/currently-playing`

#### Behavior

- `getAccessToken(...)` posts `grant_type=refresh_token` to Spotify's token endpoint using HTTP Basic auth (`clientId:clientSecret` base64 encoded).
- `getNowPlaying()` calls `getAccessToken` with the env vars, then requests the now-playing endpoint with `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`, normalizes the response, and returns a simplified object on success. If no track is playing or an error occurs it returns an error message string.

#### Spotify Setup

[This article](https://medium.com/@alagappan.dev/create-a-now-playing-widget-using-the-spotify-web-api-in-react-a6cb564ed923) helped setting up the API calls and tokens for the now playing card. The steps to connect to your spotify account is very convoluted compared to the other endpoints. This is because Spotify is a bitchass crybaby.

- First, head over to [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/), create a new app, and fill in the details
- Take Note of the `Client ID` and the `Client Secret`
  ![App Dashboard Secrets](./assets/spotifyDevDash.png)
- Next, add the local host IP (`https://127.0.0.1:5173/`) (Spotify has blacklisted `http://localhost:5173/` from being used as a redirect URI in the [latest update](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/redirect_uri))
  ![Redirect URIs](./assets/spotifyDevRedirects.png)

Now, we generate a "Refresh Token", which will be used to generate fresh "Access Tokens" for the actual api call.

- Modify the below url with your `Client ID` from the [Spotify for Developers dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)

  ```plaintext
  https://accounts.spotify.com/en/authorize?client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1:5173%2F&scope=user-read-currently-playing
  ```

- Agree to the authorization in this page
  ![Authoirization Page](assets/spotifyAuth.png)

- Next, take note of the url of the redirected page, it should have a `?code=` parameter, like so,

  ```plaintext
  http://127.0.0.1:5173/?code=<SOME_REALLY_LONG_STRING>
  ```

- Now, generate a `base64` string of the form `<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>:<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>` (`e81...a07:0b0...57c`). The base64 scting can be generated [online here](https://www.base64encode.org/)
- Modify this `curl` command by adding the generated base64 string, and the `code` from the url earlier

  ```bash
  curl
  -H "Authorization: Basic <BASE64_CLIENT_ID_AND_SECRET_STRING>"
  -d grant_type=authorization_code
  -d code=<CODE_FROM_URL>
  -d redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:5173/ https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
  ```

  the command should look something like this:

  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Basic ZTg...N2M=" -d grant_type=authorization_code -d code=AQA...Eag -d redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:5173/ https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
  ```

- The `curl` command should return the following response. From this, make note of the `refresh_token`

  ```json
  {
    "access_token": "BQD...fSw",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "refresh_token": "AQA...OGw",
    "scope": "user-read-currently-playing"
  }
  ```

- Now, store all the noted values of `Client ID`, `Client Secrt`, and this `refresh_token` in their respective environemt variables (see [Spotify Envs](#spotify-envs))

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joejo-joestar/joestar-middleware
cd joestar-middleware
```

2. Run to install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the required environment variables (refer to the [example `.env` file](./.env.example))
4. Start the server with

```bash
npm start
```

5. Access the endpoints at `http://localhost:3000/<endpoint>`

> [!TIP]
> You can use an API client to test the endpoints
>
> Try out [Yaak Client](https://github.com/mountain-loop/yaak) or [Hoppscotch Web App](https://hoppscotch.io/)
